The code for this project consists of three main components:

1. A document generation script that creates synthetic company-style texts and corresponding ground truth.
2. A prompt execution script that sends documents to a language model and saves the responses.
3. An analysis script that compares model outputs against ground truth and computes accuracy metrics.

All components are designed to be modular and scalable for future large-scale experiments.
