# Pseudocode for the experimental pipeline

# 1. Generate synthetic documents and ground truth
documents, ground_truth = generate_documents(
    positions=["start", "middle", "end"]
)

# 2. Query the language model with a fixed prompt
responses = []
for doc in documents:
    response = query_model(prompt_template, doc)
    responses.append(response)

# 3. Compare model outputs against ground truth
accuracy = compute_field_level_accuracy(responses, ground_truth)

# 4. Aggregate results by target position
summarize_results(accuracy)
