Code for the small-scale experiment:
Lost in the Middle – Context Retrieval Accuracy

This file demonstrates the experimental pipeline used in the pilot study:
1. Generate synthetic documents and ground truth
2. Query a language model using a fixed prompt
3. Parse and store model outputs
4. Compute accuracy metrics to ensure result variability

Note:
- API calls are illustrated but can be replaced or mocked.
- This file is intended to demonstrate implementation logic,
  not to serve as a production-ready system.
