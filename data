All documents used in this experiment are synthetically generated company-style texts.

Each document describes multiple fictional employees at a company. One employee is designated as the target entity, and their information is placed either at the beginning, middle, or end of the document.

Document structure and tone are loosely inspired by public company documentation patterns to improve realism, but no real individuals or proprietary information are used.
