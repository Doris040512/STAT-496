Data Description

All documents used in this experiment are synthetically generated company-style texts.

Each document describes multiple fictional employees at a company. Exactly one employee in each document is designated as the target entity.
The target employee’s information is placed at a controlled position within the document: the beginning, the middle, or the end.

Employee attributes include:
- name
- role
- department
- years_at_company
- manager
- location

These attributes are generated programmatically at document creation time. Ground truth values are stored separately and used to evaluate
model retrieval accuracy.

Document structure and writing style are loosely inspired by real-world company documentation patterns in order to improve realism. 
Publicly available company document datasets (e.g., Kaggle datasets) are used only as conceptual scaffolding for style and structure. 
No real individuals, proprietary data, or personally identifiable information are included.
