This file contains model outputs from the pilot experiment.

Each output is a JSON object produced by the language model in response to the extraction prompt. Outputs are compared against ground truth to compute field-level and document-level accuracy.

Observed errors primarily involve missing or incorrect fields, particularly when the target information appears in the middle of the document.
