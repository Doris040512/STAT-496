Model Outputs Description

This file documents the outputs produced by the language model during the small-scale pilot experiment.

For each synthetic document, the model is prompted to extract structured information about a target employee and return the result in JSON 
format. Each output corresponds to a single document and contains the following fields:

- name
- role
- department
- years_at_company
- manager
- location

All pilot outputs were syntactically valid JSON. However, the factual correctness of the extracted information varied across documents.

Observed error patterns include:
- Missing fields (e.g., fields returned as null despite being present in the document)
- Incorrect attribution of information from nearby distractor employees
- Partial extraction when information is distributed across multiple sentences

These errors occurred more frequently when the target employee’s information appeared in the middle of the document, compared to the 
beginning or the end.

Raw model outputs are saved to enable reproducibility, manual inspection, and automated comparison against ground truth during analysis.
