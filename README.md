# Lost in the Middle: Context Retrieval Accuracy

This folder contains a small-scale exploratory experiment investigating whether a large language model’s ability to retrieve factual information depends on where that information appears in a long context.

Specifically, we test whether factual retrieval accuracy degrades when target information is placed in the middle of a document, compared to the beginning or the end.

This experiment is intentionally small-scale and exploratory. Its goal is to validate feasibility, surface meaningful variation in model behavior, and motivate future large-scale automation and statistical analysis.

This project uses real-world company document text as scaffolds from Kaggle:
